"TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types. It is all about type safety. Sometimes JavaScript exhibits unexpected behavior. For example, if you write:

```typescript
2 + "2";

```
It will return '22'. However, with TypeScript, all of these problems just disappear.

TypeScript is a programming language built on top of JavaScript. It enhances JavaScript by offering several features that aid in creating more robust and maintainable applications while reducing development time. The most significant feature TypeScript provides is static typing.

Static typing, a core concept in TypeScript, is what sets it apart. In programming, we have two main categories: statically typed languages and dynamically typed languages.

<ul>
    <li type="circle">
        <bold>Statically Typed Languages</bold> (e.g., C++, C#, Java) require declaring a variable's type at compile time or during coding. For example, a variable can be declared as an integer, and it can only store integer values. This fixed type prevents the variable from holding a string or any other data type, making the code safer and less prone to errors.
    </li>
